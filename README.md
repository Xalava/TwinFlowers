# TwinFlowers

Twin flowers is a project mixing art, social experiment and tech

## Description

Fleurs jumelles, twin flowers, is a bioart duo: Half sculpture, half living plants, both connected to the blockchain

- One attracts you to donate ether or bitcoins. For each donation, the plant shiver of excitement. Donations get stored in the duo's wallet until the amount is enough to create a child sculpture, chosen by the community of donors

- The other has the ability to survive: It is equipped with a humidity sensor and sends alert on the network before drying out.

This project is a creation of Les Usines Louise ( art ) and Xavier Lavayssi√®re ( Code ) inspired by the Plantoid by Primavera de Philippi
